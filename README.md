# Reminder-app-using-c
I created this app using nested BST's using c.....

You can compile the main.c using c compiler for excutable or you can even download the "NotificationApp.exe" file which is the excutable of main.c if you don't have and c compiler.

You can even change the icon of excutable by creating the shortcut of it as follows.
1. Create a shortcut by right clicking the executable.
2. By right clicking on the shortcut and select "properties" tab.
3. Then click on change icon tab and select an icon.
4. Click on 'Apply' tab.
5. Move this shortcut icon to the desktop and enjoy using it....!
Note:-  
* Don't click 'close' button instead use '12' option to 'Exit'.
* After closing the app 'Reminder.txt' file is create where all the reminders are stored.
* If you want the move the executable then move along with Reminder.txt file.
